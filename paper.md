# [Conformal Prediction for Deep Classifier via Label Ranking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06430)

Softmax probability results in long-tail distribution, theoretically making APS's prediction set become large.
We expect that for easier data, the prediction set's length will be smaller.
However, RAPS (Regularized Adaptive Prediction Set)'s prediction set is highly regularized with value between k-1 and k if Ar denote the accuracy of the top r
predictions for a trained model πˆ on an infinite calibration set.
k is the integer satisfying Ak ≥ 1 − α > Ak−1
